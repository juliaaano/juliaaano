Hello, my name is Juliano.

I am a **software engineer** who over the years has always aspired to build quality software and develop practices and knowledge to elevate the field I work on.

I've spent most of my IT career working with **enterprise software**. During this time, my passion and skills have grown towards the areas of **architecture**, **design** and **integration**. More specifically, I have put extra effort into subjects like [Domain-driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design){:target="_blank"}, [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding){:target="_blank"}, [Event-driven architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture){:target="_blank"}, [Integration Patterns](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging){:target="_blank"}, [Rules Engine](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/RulesEngine.html){:target="_blank"}, and so on...

Most recently I've been also interested in the potential and technology behind the Blockchain.

As a **programmer**, I write my code mostly in Java. I'm a Sun Certified Java Programmer (SCJP), Sun Certified Web Component Developer (SCWCD), Sun Certified Business Component Developer (SCBCD) and a Sun Certified Java Associate (SCJA).

Some people **I follow** and admire are [Gregor Hohpe](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/gregor.html){:target="_blank"}, [Robert C. Martin](https://blog.cleancoder.com){:target="_blank"}, [Roy T. Fielding](https://roy.gbiv.com){:target="_blank"}, [Jonas Bonér](https://jonasboner.com){:target="_blank"}, [Michael Feathers](https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com){:target="_blank"}, just to name a few.

**Books** that have highly influenced me are [listed here](https://www.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/2VF0KFZJ8X60C){:target="_blank"}.

I hold a BSc in Information Systems and a specialization title in Project Management with an emphasis in the PMBOK® Guide and Standards.

Travelling is absolutely part of my life and I take it seriously. Besides touristing every now and then, I have already lived, worked and studied in different countries, including Brazil, the US, Germany and Australia.

In my free time I enjoy taking photographs. Check out my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/juliaaanobm){:target="_blank"} account.
